    		<h2>Game Description</h2>
	Snake was originally developed as a two player arcade game in 1976 named blockade in which the objective was to simply survive longer than the other player. The game then evolved into the game widely used today where one player has the objective of "feeding" the snake and avoding its evergrowing body. The goal of the game is to eat as many pellets as possible and stay alive by avoiding your rapidly growing body. The snake is colored white and the goal is to consume the yellow pellets.
